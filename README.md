# Asana-Studio

Human posture evaluation is a deep-rooted problem in a smart world that has exposed many open challenges in the past. Examining human exercises plays a crucial role in various fields like video observation, biometrics, assisted living, at-home health monitoring etc. With our lives being a merry-go-round with the pandemic, people usually prefer exercising at home but need assistance to evaluate their progress. As resources are not always available during the pandemic, yoga posture recognition can be used to build a self-instruction exercise system that allows users to learn, practice exercises and evaluate scores correctly by themselves. Asana Studio is an app developed using Deep Learning Python modelo CNN (Convolutional Neural network) to help people improve their yoga postures  in real-time . The idea is based on a dataset that consists of more than 1GB of images showing different yoga postures and angles. Asana Studio is able to draw the accuracy from a specific yoga posture. The project explains different deep learning models used for pose classification.
